Distribuição de abortos no fruto de _Leucaena leucocephala (Lam.)_ de Witt” as part of the activities of  EcoEncontros---a weekly meeting organized by graduate students from theUniversidade de São Paulo's (USP) Graduate Program in Ecology. This talk was about the project developed by my group during the “2^a^ EcoEscola: Escola de Ecologia da USP”. My group investigated a possible selective abortion pattern in _L. leucocephala’s_ pods and its relationship to post copulatory cryptic female choice. Our hypothesis was that we would find significantly more abortions on the basal end of the pods. We did not find any clear abortion pattern in the pods.,NA,NA
