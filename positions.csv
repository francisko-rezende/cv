This course will walk you through the functional programming part of purrr - in other words, you will learn how to take full advantage of the flexibility offered by the .f in map(.x, .f) to iterate other lists, vectors and data.frame with a robust, clean, and easy to maintain code. During this course, you will learn how to write your own mappers (or lambda functions), and how to use predicates and adverbs. Finally, this new knowledge will be applied to a use case, so that you’ll be able to see how you can use this newly acquired knowledge on a concrete example of a simple nested list, how to extract, keep or discard elements, how to compose functions to manipulate and parse results from this list, how to integrate purrr workflow inside other functions, how to avoid copy and pasting with purrr functional tools. “",,,
online_courses,FALSE,Hierarchical and Mixed Effects Models in R,,Datacamp,2019,2019,"Course description: “This course begins by reviewing slopes and intercepts in linear regressions before moving on to random-effects. You'll learn what a random effect is and how to use one to model your data. Next, the course covers linear mixed-effect regressions. These powerful models will allow you to explore data with a more complicated structure than a standard linear regression. The course then teaches generalized linear mixed-effect regressions. Generalized linear mixed-effects models allow you to model more kinds of data, including binary responses and count data. Lastly, the course goes over repeated-measures analysis as a special case of mixed-effect modeling. This kind of data appears when subjects are followed over time and measurements are collected at intervals. Throughout the course you'll work with real data to answer interesting questions using mixed-effects models. “",,,

By the end of the interactive data analysis reporting tutorial, you will be able to generate reports straight from your R code, documenting your work — and its results — as an HTML, pdf, slideshow or Microsoft Word document.“",,,
